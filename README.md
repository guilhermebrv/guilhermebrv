  funFact: "I`ve been immersed in the world of technology since my childhood, thanks to both of my parents being
            programmers. Growing up, I was the go-to problem solver for computer issues in my circle of friends.
            And despite that promising future I never thought I had, my initial career path took me into Law.
            It was only a few years ago that I realized my true calling was in programming, leading me to make
            a significant, yet fulfilling career shift back to my roots in tech"
